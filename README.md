This is my interactive graphics portfolio, a centralized location to store and access my graphics coding work and blogs. This website was created with a Colorlib bootstrap template, and adjusted to fit my personal portfolio. One of my favorite parts is the header/banner that shows pictures of Duke and Durham. This portfolio website has been an incredibly valuable learning experience, and I will continue to add to it in the future, as I look at and create more art. Cheers!
